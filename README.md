Use `--prefix` to filter package imports with the given prefix, or `--pkg` to
iterate over imports by package, instead of by file.

Current implementation is naive by calling out to `go list` subprocesses. And
currently only pagerank centrality is implemented. Nodes are packages, and
edges are directed graph of A >- imports -> B. Edge weights are the number of
times that package A imports package B, which may be multiple if files are
iterated over instead of packages with `--pkg`.
